"""Script to run and visualise path planned.
Use this script to check that your code works. 
You can uncomment the code based on which function you want to test.
I highly recommend you write your own test functions as well.

BIG HINT: we use a very similar script to evaluate your code. 
So make sure that your code works well in this script!
